## Autotuning ##

As mentioned in the introduction the autotuning technique involves
tuning the solution to the architecture it is executed on at
runtime. This can be divided into two categories, _online_ and
_offline_. Online tuning changes the program based on runtime
information such as problem size and performance counters. Some
computations can be to expensive to performe at runtime, these include
doing an exhaustive search over a number of parameters to find the
most performant once. This can be done offline once per architecture
to build a database that can be queried at runtime.
